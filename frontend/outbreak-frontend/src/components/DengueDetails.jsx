      question: "How can I protect myself from dengue fever?",
      answer:
        "To protect yourself from dengue fever, take measures to prevent mosquito bites. Wear protective clothing, use mosquito repellents (such as citronella oil or DEET-based repellents), and install mosquito-proof screens on doors and windows. Avoid outdoor activities during peak mosquito activity hoursâ€”mid-morning and late afternoon.",
    },
    {
      question: "What should I do if I suspect I have dengue fever?",
      answer:
        "If you have a fever, rest adequately, stay hydrated with fluids like fruit juices and soup, and monitor urine output. Take only paracetamol for fever control and avoid NSAIDs like ibuprofen or diclofenac. If symptoms persist beyond two days, visit a hospital for a blood test. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience warning signs like severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or dizziness.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is dengue transmitted?",
      answer:
        "Dengue is transmitted through the bite of infected Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. These mosquitoes lay their eggs in water-filled containers, and their larvae develop into adult mosquitoes within 8-10 days. They are most active during daylight hours, especially in urban areas.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why is dengue a global health concern?",
      answer:
        "Dengue is a significant health issue worldwide, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. It affects millions annually, with hundreds of thousands developing severe dengue hemorrhagic fever. The WHO estimates that over 2.5 billion people are at risk, and dengue is now present in more than 100 countries.",
    },
    {
      question: "What should I do if someone in my family has dengue?",
      answer:
        "If a family member has dengue, protect them from further mosquito bites to prevent transmission. Ensure they rest, stay hydrated, and seek medical attention if symptoms worsen. Take extra precautions by using mosquito nets and repellents, as dengue tends to spread within close family and neighborhood clusters.",
